abstract: Human diseases involve metabolic alterations. Metabolomic profiles have served as a vital biomarker for the early identification of high-risk individuals and disease prevention. However, current approaches can only characterize individual key metabolites, without taking into account the reality that complex diseases are multifactorial, dynamic, heterogeneous, and interdependent. Here, we leverage a statistical physics model to combine all metabolites into bidirectional, signed, and weighted interaction networks and trace how the flow of information from one metabolite to the next causes changes in health state. Viewing a disease outcome as the consequence of complex interactions among its interconnected components (metabolites), we integrate concepts from ecosystem theory and evolutionary game theory to model how the health state-dependent alteration of a metabolite is shaped by its intrinsic properties and through extrinsic influences from its conspecifics. We code intrinsic contributions as nodes and extrinsic contributions as edges into quantitative networks and implement GLMY homology theory to analyze and interpret the topological change of health state from symbiosis to dysbiosis and vice versa. The application of this model to real data allows us to identify several hub metabolites and their interaction webs, which play a part in the formation of inflammatory bowel diseases. The findings by our model could provide important information on drug design to treat these diseases and beyond.
