Welcome to my website!

I am a Phd Candidate at the Chern Institute of Mathematics of Nankai University under the supervision of [Prof. Huitao Feng](http://www.cim.nankai.edu.cn/2017/0629/c6720a70372/page.htm) and [Prof. Kelin Xia](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/XIAKELIN/). My research interests include Topological and Geometric data Analysis, Machine learning, Deep learning and Mathematical AI. Particularly, I focus on using mathematical methods from topology and geometry to build mathematical AI models, and apply the mathematical AI models to real applications in molecular science.
